TODO list for ajax_ui branch - weekcalendar:

Known bugs:

 * editing a recurring event changes the start of the whole event to the date of the
occurrence from which editing started

Missing features:

 * end_recurring_period

TODOs:

 * cleanup in weekcal.js - lots of copy-and-paste programming there
 * move formatting to CSS stylesheet
 * move harcoded params to settings
 * mouseover preview of an event
 * make variable naming in weekcal.js consistent (event vs occurrence)

A big question mark:

 * support for multi-day events (???)
